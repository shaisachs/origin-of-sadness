# The Origin of Sadness

"Papa," Holly asked, "why am I sad?"

Henry's hands went on scrubbing the pan for a moment. Outside the kitchen window, a bluebird hopped from one branch to the other of the mulberry bush he had planted, just a week before Holly was born. From the folk duet on the radio, the guitar picked out a shaky complaint. The bluebird seemed to turn its head in thoughtful consideration, and then flew off.

"Why, Poppet - is it because of Mama?"

Holly did not looking up from her coloring. Before her, a line drawing of a bunny lay on the kitchen table, a pile of crayons strewn in every direction. Her right hand pinched the tip of a brown crayon, earnestly pressing into the paper so that she could finish coloring the bunny's ear.

"I know Mama isn't here. I've knew that yesterday, and I knew that this morning, and I'll know that tonight. But why am I sad just this moment, Papa? I wasn't sad before."

"Before what?" He had resumed working on the pan, to occupy his hands. Something had burnt in place on the bottom, and wouldn't scrape off even though it had sat soaking throughout lunch.

Holly set down the crayon and carefully considered her drawing. She blew softly on the paper, scattering the crayon shavings, before picking up the forest green to finish the tufts of grass at the bunny's feet. "Before you turned on the radio, I suppose. Why should that make me sad?"

Henry gave the pan a final rinse, studied his reflection in the silverish metal, as though the answer to his daughter's question might reside there.

"Are you saying that the song made you sad, is that it?" Henry plucked Holly's plate from off the table, taking care not to drop the fork on her drawing.

Holly regarded him for a moment, then exhaled a little puff of air. "Of course, that is exactly what I'm saying."

"Why then, it's a sad song. And it reminds you that Mama is gone. And that makes you sad." He gave the plate a swipe, set it in the dishwasher, and turned towards her, leaning on the countertap and wiping his hands with a towel. Even before he finished saying it, Henry knew that this answer would not satisfy her.

"Papa, what a perfectly silly thing to say." Holly brushed her hand against the paper, in the process rubbing the few remaining bits of waxy crayon into smudges on the drawing, and then fixed her drawing to the refrigerator. "It's a sad song, of course it makes me sad. But why is it a sad song? It's just some instruments on the radio, a few sounds. How does that have anything to do with Mama? No one on the radio knows that she's gone, or even who she is. Why should that make me sad?"

***

The ground was still a little damp from rain earlier in the week; the planting project would go very quickly. Henry dug another hole, prepared a little bed of soil.

"I'm ready for another seed, Poppet."

Holly dug around in the little foil pouch, brightly painted with a pair of carrots, carefully pinched a tiny seed between thumb and forefinger, and dropped them into her father's waiting hand.

"Have you figured it out yet, Papa?"

He turned the question over in his head as he placed the seed into the little depression in the soil, heaped a little bit more dirt onto the top, and patted the completed mound flat. Finally he remembered the question she had asked just after lunch.

"Have I figured out why that song made you sad? No, I'm afraid I haven't."

"Well - maybe we should turn it into a story. Like Mama says."

That was Sylvia's favorite game with Holly, to make up silly stories all day long, whether it was about someone feeding ducks at the park or the nice man at the post office.

"Well then, I'll do my best." Henry set his spade down on the ground, and sat back on his haunches. How did every good story begin? "Once upon a time, there was a good, wise king, who ruled over a vast kingdom..."

"Oh, Papa, you're telling it wrong!" Holly stretched her feet upwards, standing on her toes for a moment, and it was only then that Henry realized she had worn her new sneakers for the afternoon's chores. They had purchased them together, just yesterday after school. The sneakers were a gleaming color of white - or, they had been yesterday - with a streak of purple on both sides. The heels were made of tiny red lights that flashed whenever Holly took a step.

Holly took a breath and then sat down on the ground. "The story starts like this: 'Once upon a time, there was a little girl named... Stephie. Stephie loved to sing, all day and all night. She sang at the playground, she sang in the bath, she even sang at school! She sang while she was doing her homework, or playing with her friends, she sang while she was riding her bike.'"

"Sounds like Stephie must have had a real talent." Henry stole a surreptitious glance at her sneakers, wondering how difficult it would be to wipe off the smudge of dirt on the side of the left shoe. Miraculously, that seemed to be the only stain on the new pair of sneakers.

"Oh yes. Stephie was the best singer in her whole school, in the whole town even."

"Well, that is a lovely story. Did Stephie invent the very first sad song, is that it?" Henry gathered all the little rocks they had unearthed from the garden into a little pile, and left it by the side of the garden.

"Well, there's more to the story, of course. We haven't even reached the middle yet!" Holly's arms extended behind her, fists pressing into the ground for support. She had crushed the packet of seeds into a ball.

"Very well, then, Poppet. Let's pick up the gardening things, and continue the story after we put them away. Ok?"

***

At the edge of the yard stood a line of oak trees, stout old things that had been there since they had bought the house, and probably many years before that. Any day now, the leaves would turn a lazy shade of yellow. But already a few strays were starting to flutter off the branches, one or two or three at a time.

Raking in the shade felt good after sweating under the pounding sun in the garden. Even at this stage, before the leaves had started to fall in earnest, there were already plenty on the ground. Henry gathered them together into a pile while Holly grabbed fists full of leaves, twigs and acorns, and stuffed them into a large brown paper bag. Henry had forgotten to remind her to change into a shabbier pair of sneakers for the yard work, and so the new ones were soon marked up with little grass stains. While she worked she hummed a little.

"Are you singing one of Stephie's songs, Poppet?"

Stephie buried her hands in the vast pile of leaves, crunching them through her fingers. "I suppose so, Papa. I think this was one of her songs. Only she must have known the words."

"You mean the lyrics? I didn't even realize that there were any. I thought it was just a simple tune." Henry paused for a minute and leaned against the rake, dabbing at his forehead with the back of his hat.

Holly dropped the leaves she had gathered into the bag, wiping her hands against her jeans and frowning. "Well, maybe you and I don't know the words, but I'm sure that Stephie would have. She knew the words to every song."

"Wow. That's a lot of songs!"

"Many, many songs. More than you could count, Papa. She knew all the words because she had a song for every possible thing she wanted to do: one for reading a book, another for eating dinner, a third one for playing with her dog, and so on. So, she must have known lots and lots of songs."

"When you explain it like that, it makes perfect sense. So was this her song for picking up leaves?"

Holly picked up a single dried leaf, twirled it by the stem. "Hmm. Yes, it must have been! But now I wonder why it is that we no longer know the words."

"Maybe Stephie forgot them." Henry had gone back to raking, pulling together one last pile from the leaves on the far side of the yard.

Holly wandered up to one of the oaks at the side of the yard, touched her fingertips to its cobbled bark. She looked down to the roots, and then up to the highest branches.

"I think there was another song that she forgot, first. You see, one day while Stephie was climbing a tree, she found that she couldn't remember the words to the song she was singing."

"Oh dear. Couldn't she just choose another one?"

"What a strange idea. How would Stephie be able to climb a tree while singing a song that was meant for something else, like chopping vegetables?"

"I hadn't really thought of that, I suppose." Henry went back to raking, and Holly picked up another little pile of leaves to drop in the bag. "Well then: how did Stephie get out of the tree? Was she able to continue climbing, if she couldn't remember the words to the song?"

Holly rubbed her nose with the back of her hand a little, and began collecting leaves from the last little pile. "She couldn't, of course. Stephie didn't know how to climb without singing. And she couldn't sing the song if she didn't know the words. Fortunately she hadn't climbed very far, so she simply jumped out of the tree."

"Well, I'm glad she got out of the tree."

"Yes, but Papa - Stephie still wanted to climb trees! She just couldn't remember the words. She asked her friends, and her teachers, and her parents, she even asked the dog. But no one could help her."

"So then, what did she do?"

"Well, there was a great and powerful sorceress, who lived in the middle of a vast forest. Stephie decided that she should visit the sorceress, to see whether the sorceress had a potion which could help her memory."

"That must have been very brave of Stephie."

"Well, she had her song for walking through the woods, and she had her backpack, and a map. She made plenty of peanut butter sandwiches, and packed a bottle of water. And as she hiked through the forest, Stephie sang and sang, which made the journey go quickly."

"What a good idea. She sounds like quite a clever little girl."

Holly shrugged. She had just about finished putting the last few leaves into the paper bag, and at the bottom of the pile she had found an acorn, a perfectly formed little nut, and had decided to try to prise off the cap with her fingernail.

They had finished rolling out the dough and Holly still had not mentioned the ending to her story. Henry had done his best to be patient, letting her think about it while they mashed up the berries, and waited for them to boil, and added sugar and syrup so that it would thicken.

With the table still covered in flour, he finally gave in to his curiosity. "And so, Poppet? What happened when Stephie finally found the sorceress? Did she get her magic potion?"

"Oh, no, Papa," Holly responded, chewing her lip as she carefully pushed the rolling pin over the dough one more time. "The sorceress didn't have a potion for Stephie. In fact she didn't have any potions at all!"

"What sort of sorceress doesn't have a magic potion?"

"Well, this sorceress must have been too busy helping little girls with their problems to bother brewing up potions."

"I see." Henry picked up the dough that Holly had rolled out, and carefully set it in the pie tin. He grabbed two spoons, handing one to Holly, and they both began spooning the sticky mulberry jam into the pie. "So then - what did Stephie do? Was the sorceress able to help her at all?"

"Well, the sorceress told Holly that there was an enchanted pond at the edge of the forest. She told Stephie that she would be able to remember the words, if she went to the pond. So, Stephie went to the pond, and she sat down at the edge. At first the waters were very muddy, but after a few minutes they cleared up. And in the water of the pond she could see herself climbing a tree!"

"How marvelous!" Henry felt the door of the oven, to check that it was warm enough for the pie. "So once she saw herself in the water - Stephie was able to remember the lyrics, after all?" He carefully set the pie in the oven, and removed his oven mitts.

"Yes. Stephie saw herself climbing and remembered the lyrics, just as they had been before. But then the waters grew cloudy again. And she found that while she still knew the words to the song, she couldn't remember how to climb a tree."

Henry sighed, grabbed a chair from the table, and sat down heavily. He looked down at the linoleum floo, the checkerboard black-and-white pattern fading from years of stains and scuff marks. A single crushed mulberry hung on to the toe of Holly's right shoe, amidst a dusting of white specs of flour. The lights in the heel didn't blink. "Maybe she could go back to the sorceress, and ask her for some help?"

Holly licked at a bit of jam on her thumb. "She tried that, of course. But she couldn't find the way any more. She would go in to the forest, certain she remembered, and just wind up walking in circles. One time she thought maybe she had found the right path - but there was no trace of the sorceress's house, when she got to the clearing. She never found it again, and she never climbed another tree."

***

The pie was nearly done. Henry still sat at the kitchen table, staring out the window. Beside him, Holly clutched a glass of milk, swinging her feet back and forth.

"It's a sad thing when you know the song, but you can't do the thing the song is telling you to do. Isn't it, Poppet?"

"Very, very sad, Papa."

"Even though Stephie never climbed another tree - do you suppose she did other things?"

Stephie placed her chin in her hand, studying the afternoon sun reflected on the table top as though it might help her explain something very simple. "Papa, Stephie did many, many other things. She knew all of those songs, remember? And she must have learned more, as she grew older."

Henry smiled thinly, wrapped his knuckles on the table once. "Did I ever tell you about the first dance at our wedding?"

Holly shook her head mid-sip, dribbling a bit of milk down her chin.

"It was a beautiful old French love song, with trumpets and violins and probably some cymbals. It went a little like this: ba-dum, ba-dum, ya da da-da..." Henry wiggled his fingers a bit in the air, his hands flying about like butterflies.

"Was Mama a good dancer?"

"Oh you wouldn't believe it, she was the best dancer. Mama could dance any song she chose. Even if she'd never heard it before, she'd start by tapping her feet and nodding her head. Before you knew it she had taken over the dance floor."

"And you never danced again, after the wedding?" Holly's eyes were wide, the glass of milk held steady by her hands in her lap.

"Well, yes we did, but it was never the same, was it? After all, how many weddings did Mama and I have?" Henry tapped an index finger on his upper lip, as though in serious thought.

"Only one, silly!" Holly giggled and commenced kicking her feet under the table.

"Ah that's right, we only had one wedding. And only one first dance at the wedding. But after that we had something even better than a wedding, didn't we?"

The oven timer went off, an insistent beep. "Dessert?" Holly asked.

Henry caught a swinging foot under the table, and gave a little squeeze. "Something much, much better than that, Poppet."

***

Henry sat on the edge of the bed, Holly lying on her pillow in Beatrix Potter pajamas. She had remembered, thank goodness, to take her shoes off befor climbing in. There they lay in the corner, underneath the director's chair with her name monogrammed in big, swoopy letters on the back.

"I was thinking of something just now, Poppet. Do you suppose that the song you heard on the radio was Stephie's climbing song?"

"Perhaps. Or maybe it was just another song, with the same tune."

Henry stood up and paced for a bit, watching his daughter from the mirror above her dresser. He tried to remember what it was they had listened to on the radio, attempted to whistle it. "Like that? Was that Holly's tune, Poppet?"

Holly smiled, her eyelids heavy. "Yes, I think that must have been it, Papa. Only - don't call me Poppet, please."

Henry winced, but Holly hadn't seen it; her eyes were already closed. "Why not?" he asked, slowly enunciating the sounds.

"Well, I'm not really your puppet, am I?" She had turned over, facing the lamp on her bedside table, and pulled the chain to turn it off. "I'm just your Holly, you see."

He walked to the door, hesitated for a moment for a moment. Finally he sighed and stepped out.

"Very well, Holly. Sweet dreams."

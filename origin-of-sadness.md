# The Origin of Sadness

"Papa," Sophie asked, "why am I sad?"

Henry's hands went on scrubbing the pan for a moment. Outside the kitchen window, a bluebird hopped from one branch to the other of the mulberry bush he had planted, just a week before Sophie was born. From the folk duet on the radio, the guitar picked out a shaky complaint. The bluebird seemed to turn its head in thoughtful consideration, and then flew off.

"Why, Poppet - it must be because Mama isn't home. Don't worry - she'll be home next Friday."

Sophie did not looking up from her coloring. Before her, a line drawing of a bunny lay on the kitchen table, a pile of crayons strewn in every direction. Her right hand pinched the tip of a brown crayon, earnestly pressing into the paper so that she could finish coloring the bunny's ear.

"I know Mama isn't home. She's been gone for a whole day now. And I'm not worried - every time she leaves she returns. But why am I sad just this moment, Papa? I wasn't sad before."

"Before what?" He had resumed working on the pan. A bit of cheese had been burnt in place on the bottom, and wouldn't scrape off even though it had sat soaking throughout lunch.

Sophie set down the crayon and carefully considered her drawing. She blew softly on the paper, scattering the crayon shavings, before picking up the forest green to finish the tufts of grass at the bunny's feet. "Before you turned on the radio, I suppose. Why should that make me sad?"

Saturdays alone with Sophie were a delight he had not anticipated. When Sylvie had first announced her rigorous travel schedule, one week a month over the course of an entire year, it had seemed that these weekends would stretch on forever, the need to chase after Sophie and keep her entertained all day. But after a few weekends he found that they passed almost too quickly, that Sophie's nonstop chatter kept him hopelessly fascinated, even if she never seemed to pick up her toys. With Sylvie's travel schedule winding down, this weekend would be their last alone, certainly for a long while. Soon enough it would be his wife answering these mystifying questions.

"Are you saying that the song made you sad, is that it?"

Sophie regarded him for a moment, then exhaled a little puff of air. "Of course, that is exactly what I'm saying."

"Why then, it's a sad song. And it reminds you that Mama is gone. And that makes you sad." Henry turned towards his daughter, leaning on the countertop and wiping his hands with a towel. Even before he finished saying it, he knew that this answer would not satisfy her.

"Papa, what a perfectly silly thing to say." Sophie brushed her hand against the paper, in the process rubbing the few remaining bits of waxy crayon into smudges on the drawing, and then fixed her drawing to the refrigerator with a magnet. "It's a sad song, of course it makes me sad. But why is it a sad song? It's just some instruments on the radio, a few sounds. How does that have anything to do with Mama? No one on the radio knows that she's gone, or even who she is. Why should that make me sad?"

***

The ground was still a little damp from rain earlier in the week, and so the soil yielded easily to the spade. Henry turned the dirt over, created a little mound, and pressed his thumb into the top.

"I'm ready for another seed, Poppet."

Sophie dug around in the little foil pouch, brightly painted with a pair of carrots, carefully pinched a tiny seed between thumb and forefinger, and dropped them into her father's waiting hand.

"Have you figured it out yet, Papa?"

He turned the question over in his head as he placed the seed into the little depression in the soil, heaped a little bit more dirt onto the top, and patted the completed mound flat. Finally he remembered the question she had asked just after lunch.

"Have I figured out why that song made you sad? No, I'm afraid I haven't."

"Well - maybe we should turn it into a story. Like Mama says."

That was Sylvie's favorite game with Sophie, to make up silly stories all day long, whether it was about someone feeding ducks at the park or the nice man at the post office. Easy enough for Sylvie to do, Henry thought - that was what she did all day, every day. And she had certainly trained Sophie to follow in her footsteps.

"Well then, I'll do my best." Henry set his spade down on the ground, and sat back on his haunches. How did every good story begin? "Once upon a time, there was a good, wise king, who ruled over a vast kingdom..."

"Oh, Papa, you're telling it wrong!" Sophie stretched her calves upwards, standing on her toes for a moment, and it was only then that Henry realized she had worn her new sneakers for the afternoon's chores. They had purchased them together, just yesterday after school. The sneakers were a gleaming color of white - or, they had been yesterday - with a streak of purple on both sides. The heels were made of tiny red lights that flashed whenever Sophie took a step.

Sophie inhaled deeply and sat down on the ground. "The story starts like this: 'Once upon a time, there was a little girl named... Stephie. Stephie loved to sing, all day and all night. She sang at the playground, she sang in the bath, she even sang at school! She sang while she was doing her homework, or playing with her friends, she sang while she was riding her bike.'"

"Sounds like Stephie must have had a real talent, right Sophie?" Henry stole a surreptitious glance at her sneakers, wondering how difficult it would be to wipe off the smudge of dirt on the side of the left shoe. Miraculously, that seemed to be the only stain on the new pair of sneakers.

"Oh yes. Stephie was the best singer in her whole school, in the whole town even."

"Well, that is a lovely story. Did Stephie invent the very first sad song, is that it?" Henry gathered all the little rocks they had unearthed from the garden into a little pile, and left it by the side of the garden.

"Well, there's more to the story, of course. We haven't even reached the middle yet!" Sophie's arms extended behind her, fists pressing into the ground for support. She had crushed the packet of seeds into a ball.

"Very well, then, Poppet. Let's pick up the gardening things, and continue the story after we put them away. Ok?"

***

Sylvie had been a storyteller for as long as Henry could remember. When they first met, two strangers taking shelter at a bus stop from a sudden torrential downpour, she had regaled him with a long, drawn-out recounting of her miserable, awful day. Sylvie's mother had been in the hospital so she had gone to visit her; but she had parked illegally and returned to find her car towed; then she discovered she had lost her glasses; and by the time she had finally found them, and made her way to the tow yard, it had already closed. Henry felt such pity for her that he had lent her his umbrella. He had only learned that the whole story was a complete fabrication weeks later, when she finally returned it.

Back then Sylvie was just starting her career in the publishing industry. After a couple of years in the marketing department at a small but well-regarded publishing house, she was making a name for herself. Not long after they had started dating she sought, and won, a big promotion. A year after they were married, Sylvie had taken a fancy job at a much larger publisher, with a dozen different imprints and thousands of new books each year.

Then Sophie was born, and everything changed.

***

At the edge of the yard stood a line of oak trees, stout old things that had been there since they had bought the house, and probably many years before that. Any day now, the leaves would turn a lazy shade of yellow. But already a few strays were starting to flutter off the branches, one or two or three at a time.

Raking in the shade felt good after sweating under the pounding sun in the garden. Even at this stage, before the leaves had started to fall in earnest, there were already plenty on the ground. Henry gathered them together into a pile while Sophie grabbed fists full of leaves, twigs and acorns, and stuffed them into a large brown paper bag. Henry had forgotten to remind her to change into a shabbier pair of sneakers for the yard work, and so the new ones were soon marked up with little grass stains. While she worked she hummed a little.

"What do you suppose comes next in the story, Papa?" Sophie asked, burying her hands in the vast pile of leaves, crunching them through her fingers. "Is this song a part of it?"

Henry paused for a minute and leaned against the rake. "I don't think I can tell you that, Poppet. It's your story, isn't it?"

Sophie scowled for a moment, kicked her shoe through the grass absently. "Well, do you at least know the words to this song? It must have been one of Stephie' songs."

"You mean the lyrics? I didn't even realize that there were any. I thought that you were just humming a song you made up."

Sophie dropped the leaves she had gathered into the bag, wiping her hands against her jeans and frowning. "No. Stephie would have known the words. She knew the words to every song."

"She must have known quite a few songs, then."

"Many, many songs." Sophie looked down at the ground for a moment, carefully plucked a single leaf, and dropped it in the bag. "She knew more songs than you could count, Papa. She had a song for every possible thing she wanted to do: one for reading a book, another for eating dinner, a third one for playing with her dog, and so on. But that was the problem. One day while she was climbing a tree, she found that she couldn't remember the words to the song she was singing."

"Oh dear. Couldn't she just choose another one?"

"What a strange idea. How would Stephie be able to climb a tree while singing a song that was meant for something else, like chopping vegetables?"

"I hadn't really thought of that." Henry went back to raking, and Sophie picked up another little pile of leaves to drop in the bag. "Well then: how did Stephie get out of the tree? Was she able to continue climbing, if she couldn't remember the words to the song?"

Sophie rubbed her nose with the back of her hand a little. "She couldn't, of course. Stephie didn't know how to climb without singing. And she couldn't sing the song if she didn't know the words. Fortunately she hadn't climbed very far, so she simply jumped out of the tree."

"Well, I suppose that solved the problem, then."

"No, not at all! Stephie still wanted to climb trees. But try as she might, she couldn't remember the words. She asked her friends, and her teachers, and her parents, she even asked the dog. But no one could help her."

"So then, what did she do?"

"Well, there was a great and powerful sorceress, who lived in the middle of a vast forest. Stephie decided that she should visit the sorceress, to see whether the sorceress had a potion which could help her memory."

"Don't you think that would have been dangerous? Did Stephie bring her parents with her?"

"Perhaps a little dangerous. But it was Stephie's song, and only Stephie's song. So she must have made the journey by herself. Besides, she had her song for walking through the woods, and she had her backpack, and a map. She made plenty of peanut butter sandwiches, and packed a bottle of water. And as she hiked through the forest, Stephie sang and sang, which made the journey go quickly."

Henry dabbed at his forehead with the back of his hat. "Still, it sounds like it might have been awfully scary for Stephie."

Sophie shrugged. She had just about finished putting the last few leaves into the paper bag, and at the bottom of the pile she had found an acorn, a perfectly formed little nut, and had decided to try to prise off the cap with her fingernail.

***

Sylvie had gone back to work when Sophie was six months old. Those had been hectic, but wonderful days, and somehow they had made it work, with Henry coming home early to take Sophie from the nanny and Sylvie taking care of Sophie in the early mornings. Their daughter was a bright, curious thing, who babbled from her crib non-stop and loved anything that was shiny or crinkly.

For a while it seemed as though everything was perfect, despite all the work of raising a newborn. Sylvie was doing well at her job - her books were selling well and it seemed as though she could turn almost any manuscript into a best-seller by sheer force of will. There was talk of another promotion, a still-better job with still-longer hours.

It was just after Sophie's second birthday, a little before Easter, that Sylvie decided she wanted something different altogether. One night she came home, just after Henry had put Sophie to bed. "I want to make films," she had said, simple as that, the glossy catalog for the art school that offered night classes poking out of her purse.

***

They had finished rolling out the dough and Sophie still had not mentioned the ending to her story. Henry had done his best to be patient, letting her think about it while they mashed up the berries, and waited for them to boil, and added sugar and syrup so that it would thicken.

With the table still covered in flour, he finally gave in to his curiosity. "I think I know what must have happened next, Poppet. The sorceress had a magic potion for Stephie, and that is how she got her climbing song back. Right?"

"Oh, Papa." Sophie bit her lip as she carefully pushed the rolling pin over the dough one more time. "This is my story, remember? You can't just go making things up like that. The sorceress didn't have a potion for Stephie. In fact she didn't have any potions at all!"

"What sort of sorceress doesn't have a magic potion?"

"Well, a sorceress who lives in the middle of a vast forest, of course. She must have been too busy helping little girls with their problems to bother brewing up potions."

Henry picked up the dough that Sophie had rolled out, and carefully set it in the pie tin. He grabbed two spoons, handing one to Sophie, and they both began spooning the sticky mulberry jam into the pie. "This story is very strange, Sophie. Was the sorceress able to help poor Stephie at all?"

"Well, the sorceress taught Stephie an enchanted tune, you see. And she told Stephie that if she hummed that tune and thought of her climbing song, then she would remember the words to the song after all."

Henry frowned, and decided better than to object. He walked over to the oven, felt the door to check that it was warm enough for the pie. "So Stephie was able to remember the lyrics, after all?"

"Well, yes, but there was a problem. Because after Stephie returned from the forest, she tried what the sorceress had told her. And she found that she could remember the words, perfectly. But she had forgotten to ask the sorceress one other thing."

Henry carefully set the pie in the oven, and removed the oven mitts. He held his breath before asking, "What was that?"

"How to climb a tree! Stephie had forgotten how to climb a tree. When she got back home she found that she could sing her song perfectly well, but she didn't know what to do while singing it."

Henry sighed, grabbed a chair from the table, and sat down heavily. "I'm not sure I like this story so much, Sophie. Are you really sure this is how it goes?"

Sophie licked at a bit of jam on her thumb. "I'm certain, Papa. If you don't like the story, then you don't have to listen to the ending."

Henry looked down at the linoleum floor, the checkerboard black-and-white pattern fading from years of stains and scuff marks. A single crushed mulberry hung on to the toe of Sophie's right shoe, amidst a dusting of white specs of flour. The lights in the heel didn't blink. "Well - couldn't Stephie just return to the sorceress? To ask her how to climb a tree?"

Sophie smirked at him, and popped one of the spoons into her mouth. "She tried that, of course. But she couldn't find the way any more. She would go in to the forest, certain she knew the way, and just wind up walking in circles. One time she thought maybe she had found the right path - but there was no trace of the sorceress's house, when she got to the clearing. She never found it again, and she never climbed another tree."

***

The years in film school were difficult enough, with Sylvie often too tired to take care of Sophie in the mornings, or returning too late for bedtime. But it was Sylvie's decision to quit her job and to try to produce her own films that finally caused Henry to snap, a blistering fusillade of questions after Sophie's bed time.

What, he asked her, would they do without her salary? He did not make nearly enough by himself to support the three of them - and it would be many years before she would be earning any kind of money, let alone enough to replace the generous salary she had been earning as a marketing executive.

It was not a gentle argument, nor a short one. For years they bickered over finances, doing their best to hide the bitter fights from Sophie, and often failing. Sylvie made one film, and then another and another - and lost money on each one. Henry had looked up one divorce lawyer after another. There was even a lonesome afternoon when he had punched a phone number into his phone; it was the buzz of the washing machine, announcing the end of the spin cycle, which had pulled him away.

***

The pie was nearly done. Henry still sat at the kitchen table, staring out the window. Beside him, Sophie clutched a glass of milk, swinging her feet back and forth.

"It's a sad thing when you know the song, but you can't do the thing the song is telling you to do. Isn't it, Poppet?"

"Very, very sad, Papa."

"Did I ever tell you about the first dance at our wedding?"

Sophie shook her head mid-sip, dribbling a bit of milk down her chin.

"It was a beautiful old French love song, with trumpets and violins and probably some cymbals. It went a little like this: ba-dum, ba-dum, ya da da-da..." Henry wiggled his fingers a bit in the air, his hands flying about like butterflies.

"Was Mama a good dancer?"

"Oh you wouldn't believe it, she was the best dancer. Mama could dance any song she chose. Even if she'd never heard it before, she'd start by tapping her feet and nodding her head. Before you knew it she had taken over the dance floor."

"And you never danced again, after the wedding?" Sophie's eyes were wide, the glass of milk held steady by her hands in her lap.

"Well, yes we did, but it was never the same, was it? After all, how many weddings did Mama and I have?" Henry tapped an index finger on his upper lip, as though in serious thought.

"Only one, silly!" Sophie giggled and commenced kicking her feet under the table.

"Ah that's right, we only had one wedding. And only one first dance at the wedding. But after that we had something even better than a wedding, didn't we?"

The oven timer went off, an insistent beep. "Dessert?" Sophie asked.

Henry caught a swinging foot under the table, and gave a little squeeze. "Something much, much better than that, Poppet."

***

This film would be Sylvie's fifth, and the riskiest project yet. It was something rather ambitious, a high-tech thriller with filming locations all over the country. Yesterday she had left town to wrap up the last week of shooting; when she returned, she would begin the laborious editing process, and with any luck the movie would be released next year.

It seemed like ages ago, when Henry had discovered the script for the film. There on the shelf in the laundry room, he had found a stack of typed pages rolled into a tube, held together by a rubber band. Sylvie had taken Sophie on an errand run, and wouldn't be back for several hours. He had unrolled the thick bundle and started to read. Some pages were heavily scarred with red ink, others with just a couple of inscrutable underlines and question marks. A scene towards the end of the screenplay had caught his eye, a few lines of dialogue circled three or four times over. In the margin, a cartoon drawing of a girl with buggy eyes and a slightly upturned nose that could only be his daughter.

That night, after putting Sophie to bed, he had opened a bottle of wine, presented a half-full glass to Sylvie with one hand, and the rolled up manuscript with the other. Casting a star with wide appeal, one who looked something like a grown-up Sophie, had been Sylvie's idea. It had been Henry who encouraged her to seek investors from her old contacts in publishing. The movie would be theirs.

***

Henry sat on the edge of the bed, Sophie lying on her pillow in Beatrix Potter pajamas. She had remembered, thank goodness, to take her shoes off before climbing in. There they lay in the corner, underneath the child-size director's chair with her name monogrammed in big, swoopy letters on the back.

"I was thinking of something just now, Poppet. Do you suppose that the song you heard on the radio was Stephie's climbing song?"

"Perhaps. Or maybe it was just another song, with the same tune."

He tried to remember what it was they had listened to on the radio, attempted to whistle it. "Like that? Was that Sophie's tune, Poppet?"

Sophie smiled, her eyelids heavy. "Yes, I think that must have been it, Papa. Only - don't call me Poppet, please."

Henry winced, but Sophie hadn't seen it; her eyes were already closed. "Why not ... Sophie?"

"Well, I'm not really your puppet, am I?" She had turned over, facing the lamp on her bedside table, and pulled the chain to turn it off. "I'm just your Sophie, you see."

Henry stood up, paced back and forth between the door for a moment. Finally he sighed, opened the door, and stepped out.

"Very well, Sophie. Sweet dreams."

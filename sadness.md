A song on the radio makes Sophie sad, so she asks her dad why she is sad. The previous night, her mother left on a long business trip, and he thinks that is what makes Sophie sad. But she wants to know something different - what is it about the song that makes her sad?

That afternoon they are planting the vegetable garden together when Sophie has an idea to make up a story about the first sad song. It's a story about a girl who loves to sing, but there is a song whose lyrics she can't remember.

When they are done planting the vegetable garden, it's time to rake leaves and pick up sticks in the yard. As they are doing so, Sophie continues telling her story, about the girl traveling deep into the woods to visit a mysterious sorceress who can help her remember the words to the song. At one point she decides that she wants to go and paint a picture of the sorceress, but Henry insists that she finish her chores. Sophie refuses, and stomps off to her room.

We now learn that long ago, Henry had had a similar fight with Sophie's mother, Sylvie. When Sophie was only a year old Sylvie decided to go to night school to learn to make films; Henry had protested vociferously, and Sylvie had eventually won.

Henry seeks out his daughter in her room after she has calmed down. Because he wouldn't let her paint, she's decided to decorate the walls in crayon. Despite their fight he admires her drawing and allows her to leave it up.

Henry puts his daughter to bed when he remembers to ask her the ending to their story. The sorceress told Stephie that there was a magic tune which would help her remember the words to her song - but that learning the tune would always remind her of a time she could no longer return to, a time before she forgot the song. Stephie decides to learn the tune, and it makes her sad to think of that time - but it also helps her remember it more. As a reward for finishing her story, Sophie asks her father not to use a pet name anymore, deciding that she's too old for it now. He agrees.

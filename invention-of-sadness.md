# The Invention of Sadness

"Papa," Sophie asked, "why am I sad?"

Henry Creek's hands went on scrubbing the pan for a moment. Outside the kitchen window, a bluebird hopped from one branch to the other of the mulberry bush he had planted, just a week before Sophie was born. From the jazz quartet on the radio, the trumpet blared an improvised complaint, and the bluebird seemed to turn its head in thoughtful consideration, and then flew off.

"Why, Poppet - it must be because Mama isn't home. Don't worry - she'll be home next Friday."

Sophie did not looking up from her coloring. In her hands, a line drawing of a bunny lay on the kitchen table, a pile of crayons strewn in every direction. Her left hand pinched the tip of a brown crayon, earnestly pressing into the paper so that she could finish coloring the bunny's right ear.

"I know Mama isn't home. She's been gone for a whole day now. And I'm not worried - every time she leaves she returns. But why am I sad just this moment, Papa? I wasn't sad before."

"Before what?" He had resumed working on the pan. A bit of cheese had been burnt in place on the bottom, and wouldn't scrape off even though it had sat soaking throughout lunch.

Sophie set down the crayon and carefully considered her drawing. She blew softly on the paper, scattering the crayon shavings, before picking up the forest green to finish the tufts of grass at the bunny's feet. "Before you turned on the radio, I suppose. Why should that make me sad?"

Saturdays alone with Sophie were a delight he had not anticipated. When Sylvie had first announced her rigorous travel schedule, one week a month over the course of an entire year, it had seemed that these weekends would stretch on forever, the need to chase after Sophie and keep her entertained all day. But after a few months he found that they passed almost too quickly, that Sophie's nonstop chatter kept him endlessly fascinated, even if she never seemed to pick up her toys. With Sylvie's travel schedule winding down, this weekend would be their last alone, certainly for a long while, and soon enough it would be his wife answering these mystifying questions.

"Are you saying that the song made you sad, is that it?"

Sophie regarded him for a moment, then beyond to the window. "Of course, that is exactly what I'm saying."

"Why then, it's a sad song. And it reminds you that Mama is gone. And that makes you sad." He put the pan away and turned towards her, leaning on the countertap and wiping his hands with a towel. He knew, somehow, that this answer would not satisfy her.

"Papa, what a perfectly silly thing to say." Sophie brushed her hand against the paper, in the process rubbing the few remaining bits of waxy crayon into smudges on the drawing, and then fixed her drawing to the refrigerator. "It's a sad song, of course it makes me sad. But why is it a sad song? It's just some instruments on the radio, a few sounds. How does that have anything to do with Mama? No one on the radio knows that she's gone, or even who she is. Why should that make me sad?"

The ground was still a little damp from rain earlier in the week, and so the soil yielded easily to the spade. Henry turned the dirt over, created a little mound, and pressed his thumb into the top.

"I'm ready for another seed, Poppet."

Sophie dug around in the little foil pouch, brightly painted with a pair of carrots, and carefully pinched a tiny seed between thumb and forefinger, and dropped them into her father's waiting hand.

"Have you figured it out yet, Papa?"

He turned the question over in his head as he placed the seed into the little depression in the soil, heaped a little bit more dirt onto the top, and patted the completed mound flat. And finally he remembered the question she had asked just after lunch.

"Have I figured out why that song made you sad? No, I'm afraid I haven't."

"Well - maybe we should turn it into a story. Like Mama says."

That was Sylvie's favorite game with Sophie, to make up silly stories all day long, whether it was about someone feeding ducks at the park or the nice man at the post office. Easy enough for Sylvie to do, Henry thought - that was what she did all day, every day. And she had certainly trained Sophie to follow in her footsteps.

"Well then, I'll do my best." Henry set his spade down on the ground, and sat back on his haunches. How did every good story begin? "Once upon a time, there was a king in a castle, who ruled over a vast kingdom..."

"No, Papa, you're telling it wrong!" Sophie stamped her foot into the grass, and it was only at that moment that Henry realized she had worn her new sneakers for the afternoon's chore. They were brand new, purchased just yesterday after school. The sneakers were a gleaming color of white - or in any case, they had been yesterday - with a streak of purple on both sides and heels made of plastic with shiny red lights that turned on whenever Sophie took a step. "The story starts like this: 'Once upon a time, there was a little girl named... Stephie. Stephie loved to sing, all day and all night. She sang at the playground, she sang in the bath, she even sang at school! She sang while she was doing her homework, or playing with her friends, she sang while she was riding her bike.'"

"Sounds like Stephie must have had a real talent, right Sophie?" Henry stole a surreptitious glance at her sneakers, wondering how difficult it would be to wipe off the smudge of dirt on the side of the left shoe. Miraculously, that seemed to be the only stain on the new pair of sneakers.

"Oh yes. Stephie was the best singer in her whole school, in the whole town even."

"Well, that is a marvelous story. Did Stephie invent the very first sad song, is that it?" Henry gathered all the little rocks they had unearthed from the garden into a little pile, and left it by the side of the garden.

"No! There's more to the story, you should know that! We haven't even reached the middle yet!" Sophie's face was drawn into a deep scowl, and without realizing it she had balled the packet of seeds into a fist.

"Very well, then, Poppet. Let's pick up the gardening things, and continue the story after we put them away. Ok?"

Sylvie had been a story teller for as long as Henry could remember. When they first met, taking shelter at a bus stop from a sudden torrential downpour, she had regaled him with a long, drawn-out recounting of her miserable, awful day. Sylvie's mother had been in the hospital so she had gone to visit her; but she had parked illegally and returned to find her car towed; then she discovered she had lost her glasses; and by the time she had finally found them, and made her way to the tow yard, it had already closed. He felt such pity for her that he had lent her his umbrella; and had only learned that the whole story was a complete fabrication weeks later, when she finally returned it.

Back then Sylvie was just starting her career in the publishing industry. After a couple of years in the marketing department at a small but well-regarded publishing house, she was making a name for herself. Not long after they had started dating she sought, and won, a big promotion. A year after they were married, Sylvie had taken a fancy job at a much larger publisher, with a dozen different imprints and thousands of new books each year.

Then Sophie was born, and everything changed.

At the edge of the yard stood a line of maple trees, stout old things that had been there since they had bought the house, and probably many years before that. Any day now, the leaves would turn a bright shade of red. But already they were starting to flutter off the branches, one or two or three at a time.

Raking in the shade felt good after sweating under the pounding sun in the garden. Even at this stage, before the leaves had started to fall in earnest, there were already quite a few leaves on the ground. Henry gathered them together into a big pile while Sophie grabbed fists full of leaves, twigs and acorns, and stuffed them into a large brown paper bag. Henry had forgotten to remind her to change into a shabbier pair of sneakers for the yard work, and so the new ones were soon marked up with little grass stains. While she worked she hummed a little.

"Is that one of the songs that Stephie liked to sing?" Henry asked, pausing for a minute and leaning against his rake.

Sophie dropped the leaves she had gathered into the bag, and wiped them off before answering. "No, I don't think so. Because Sophie preferred to sing, you see. With words."

"Ah, that sounds lovely. Did she know quite a few songs, then?"

"Many, many songs. More than you could count, Papa. She had a song for every possible thing she wanted to do: one for reading a book, another for eating dinner, a third one for playing with her dog, and so on. But that was the problem. One day while she was climbing a tree, she found that she couldn't remember the words to the song she was singing."

"Oh dear. Couldn't she just choose another one?"

"What a perfectly silly idea. How would Stephie be able to climb a tree while singing a song that was meant for something else, like chopping vegetables?"

"I hadn't really thought of that, I suppose." Henry went back to raking, and Sophie picked up another little pile of leaves to drop in the bag. "Well then: how did Stephie get out of the tree? Was she able to continue climbing, if she couldn't remember the words to the song?"

Sophie rubbed her nose with the back of her hand a little. "Exactly, Papa. Stephie didn't know how to climb without singing. And she couldn't sing. Fortunately she hadn't climbed very far, so she simply jumped out of the tree."

"Well, I suppose that solved the problem, then."

"For the moment, but of course Stephie still wanted to climb trees. But try as she might, she couldn't remember the words. She asked her friends, and her teachers, and her parents, she even asked the dog. But no one could help her."

"So then, what did she do?"

"Well, there was a great and powerful sorceress, who lived in the middle of a vast forest. Stephie decided that she should visit the sorceress, to see whether the sorceress had a potion which could help her memory."

"That must have been very brave of Stephie."

"Of course. But she had her song for walking through the woods, and she had her backpack, and a map. She made plenty of peanut butter sandwiches, and packed a bottle of water. And as she hiked through the forest, Stephie sang and sang, which made the journey go quickly."

"What a good idea. Stephie sounds like quite a clever little girl."

Sophie shrugged. She had just about finished putting the last few leaves into the paper bag, and at the bottom of the pile she had found an acorn, a perfectly formed little nut, and had decided to try to prise off the cap with her fingernail.

Sylvie had gone back to work when Sophie was six months old. Those had been difficult, hectic days, but they had made it work, with Henry coming home early to take Sophie from the nanny and Sylvie taking care of Sophie in the early mornings. Their daughter was a bright, curious thing, who babbled from her crib non-stop and loved anything that was shiny or crinkly.

For a while it seemed as though everything was perfect, despite all the work of raising a newborn. Sylvie was doing well at her job - her books were selling well and it seemed as though she could turn almost any manuscript into a best-seller by sheer force of will. There was talk of another promotion, a still-better job with still-longer hours.

It was just after Stephie's second birthday that Sylvie decided she wanted something different altogether.

They had finished rolling out the dough and Sophie still had not mentioned the ending to her story. Henry had done his best to be patient, letting her think about it while they mashed up the berries, and waited for them to boil, and added sugar and syrup so that it would thicken.

With the table still covered in flour, he finally relented. "And so, Poppet? What happened when Stephie finally found the sorceress? Did she get her magic potion?"

"Oh, no, Papa," Sophie responded, chewing her lip as she carefully pushed the rolling pin over the dough one more time. "The sorceress didn't have such potions. In fact she was a little bit angry with Stephie for even asking in the first place."

"What sort of sorceress doesn't have a magic potion?"

"Well, a sorceress who lives in the middle of a vast forest, of course. She must be too busy helping little girls with their problems to bother brewing up potions."

"I see." Henry picked up the dough that Sophie had rolled out, and carefully set it in the pie tin. He and Sophie picked up spoons and began spooning the sticky mulberry jam out of the pot and on top of the dough. "So then - what did the sorceress do?"

"It was really quite simple, after all. 'Think of a time when you were sad, little girl,' the sorceress told Stephie. 'And ask your friend here to tell you about that time, whenever you are having trouble remembering Yo.'"

"So Yo became a song about a time when Stephie was said?" With the pie tin filled, Henry took a fork and crimped the edge of the pie, rotating the tin by degrees until the entire crust had been prepared.

"Oh yes, that is exactly what happened. Because you see Stephie's mother had once gone on a long, long voyage, into the forest, and she had still not returned. So Yo began to tell the story of that voyage into the forest."

"And did that help Stephie - did that help her remember Yo?" Henry opened the oven and slid the pie tin inside.

Sophie sat at the table, looking at the orange glow of the oven. Through the glass she could see the jam begin to bubble softly. In a few minutes it would solidify into a gel, and later that evening they'd have mulberry pie for dinner.

"Well, it did help her. But a curious thing happened - because as Yo began telling that story, Yo herself changed. In fact she split into two!"

"So now there were two of Yo? How marvelous." Henry had grabbed a sponge and had begun wiping down the kitchen table, wiping up the little drops of mulberry jam and stray bits of flower into his cupped hand.

"Yes, and in fact soon there wee many more than two - because the second Yo became friends with another little girl, and when that second Yo began telling another sad story, it again split into two, again and again."

"Well Poppet. Imagine that." Henry poured Sophie a glass of milk, and watched her as she watched the pie baking.

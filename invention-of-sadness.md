# The Invention of Sadness

"Papa," Sophie asked, "why am I sad?"

Henry Creek's hands went on scrubbing the pan for a moment. Outside the kitchen window, a bluebird hopped from one branch to the other of the mulberry bush he had planted, just a week before Sophie was born. From the jazz quartet on the radio, the trumpet blared an improvised complaint, and the bluebird seemed to turn its head in thoughtful consideration, and then flew off.

"Why, Poppet - it must be because Mama isn't home. You needn't worry - she'll be home next Friday."

Sophie did not bother looking up from her coloring. In her hands, a line drawing of a bunny eating a carrot lay on the kitchen table, a pile of crayons strewn in every direction. Her left hand pinched the tip of a brown crayon, earnestly pressing into the paper so that she could finish coloring the bunny's right ear.

"I know Mama isn't home. She's been gone for hours now. And I'm not worried - every time she leaves she returns. But why am I sad just this moment, Papa? I wasn't sad before."

"Before what?" He had resumed working on the pan. A bit of cheese had been burnt in place on the bottom, and wouldn't scrape off even though it had sat soaking throughout lunch.

Sophie set down the crayon and carefully considered her drawing. She blew softly on the paper, scattering the crayon shavings, before picking up the forest green to finish one empty spot at the top of the carrot. "Before you turned on the radio, I suppose. Why should that make me sad?"

Saturdays alone with Sophie were a delight he had not anticipated. When Sylvie had first announced her rigorous travel schedule, one week a month over the course of an entire year, it had seemed that these weekends would stretch on forever, the need to chase after Sophie and keep her entertained all day. But after a few months he found that they passed almost too quickly, that Sophie's nonstop chatter kept him endlessly fascinated, even if she never seemed to pick up her toys. With Sylvie's travel schedule winding down, this weekend would be their last alone, certainly for a long while, and presently it would be his wife answering these marvelous questions.

"Are you saying that the song made you sad, is that it?"

Sophie regarded him for a moment, a look of genuine concern. "Of course, that is exactly what I'm saying."

"Why then, it's a sad song. And it reminds you that Mama is gone. And that makes you sad." He put the pan away and turned towards her, leaning on the countertap and wiping his hands with a towel. He knew, somehow, that this answer would not satisfy her.

"Papa, what a perfectly silly thing to say." Sophie brushed her hand against the paper, in the process rubbing the few remaining bits of waxy crayon into smudges on the drawing, and then fixed her drawing to the refrigerator. "It's a sad song, of course it makes me sad. But why is it a sad song? It's just some instruments on the radio, a few sounds. How does that have anything to do with Mama? No one on the radio knows that she's gone, or even who she is. Why should that make me sad?"

The ground was still a little damp from rain earlier in the week, and so the soil yielded easily to the spade. Henry turned the dirt over, created a little mound, and pressed his thumb into the top.

"I'm ready for another seed, Poppet."

Sophie dug around in the little foil pouch, brightly painted with a pair of zucchini, and carefully pinched a single, tiny seed between thumb and forefinger, then dropped it into her father's waiting hand.

"Have you figured it out yet, Papa?"

He turned the question over in his head as he placed the seed into the little depression in the soil, heaped a little bit more dirt onto the top, and patted the completed mound flat.

"Have I figured out why that song was sad? No, I'm afraid I haven't."

"Well - maybe you should turn it into a story. Like Mama says."

Sylvie loved to say things like that: There's no question that can't be answered by a good story.

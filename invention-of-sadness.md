# The Invention of Sadness

"Papa," Sophie asked, "why am I sad?"

Henry Creek's hands went on scrubbing the pan for a moment. At length he paused, and looked back over his shoulder at the eight year old at the kitchen table. In her hands was a line drawing of a bunny in a grassy field, its ears half-colored with a brown crayon. A jazz quartet played on the radio by the sink, the trumpet blaring an improvised salute. "Why, Poppet - it must be because Mama isn't home. You needn't worry - she'll be home next Friday."

Sophie finished coloring one ear, and picked a beige crayon for the other ear. Her eyes flicked over to her father for a moment. "I'm not worried, I know Mama will come home. And I know she's gone - she's been gone almost the whole day now. But why should that make me sad, right at this moment?"

Sylvia Creek had left that morning, her father setting the carry-on luggage upright on the curb at the airport. Her mother had left the briefest of pecks on Henry's cheek before the traditional goodbye salute to her daughter, who had stayed in the car reading her favorite book.

The bunny ears were nearly complete, the sky had been shaded in a cheerful robin's-egg blue all through lunch, and the sun shone over the entire scene as a dab of buttercup yellow. Sophie did not, in the final analysis, seem particularly sad. Henry went back to cleaning up the lunch dishes, scrubbing away at a burnt spot on the bottom of the pan. "Well, you wish that you could play with Mama, I suppose. Or perhaps you simply can't stand the lunch I made you."

Sophie set down her crayon, picked up the paper, and considered it for a moment. She walked over to the refrigerator and attached it with a promotional magnet from Henry's real estate attorney. "Of course that's not it, Papa," she said, scooping up the crayons on the table and sweeping away the shavings. "Mama can't make pasta anywhere near as well as you can. And why would that make me sad, anyway? Don't worry, we have all day. You'll figure it out."

# The Invention of Sadness

"Papa," Sophie asked, "why am I sad?"

Henry Creek's hands went on scrubbing the pan for a moment. Outside the kitchen window, a bluebird hopped from one branch to the other of the mulberry bush he had planted, just a week before Sophie was born. From the jazz quartet on the radio, the trumpet blared an improvised complaint, and the bluebird seemed to turn its head in thoughtful consideration, and then flew off.

"Why, Poppet - it must be because Mama isn't home. You needn't worry - she'll be home next Friday."

Sophie did not bother looking up from her coloring. In her hands, a line drawing of a bunny eating a carrot lay on the kitchen table, a pile of crayons strewn in every direction. Her left hand pinched the tip of a brown crayon, earnestly pressing into the paper so that she could finish coloring the bunny's right ear.

"I know Mama isn't home. She's been gone for hours now. And I'm not worried - every time she leaves she returns. But why am I sad just this moment, Papa? I wasn't sad before."

"Before what?" He had resumed working on the pan. A bit of cheese had been burnt in place on the bottom, and wouldn't scrape off even though it had sat soaking throughout lunch.

Sophie set down the crayon and carefully considered her drawing. She blew softly on the paper, scattering the crayon shavings, before picking up the forest green to finish one empty spot at the top of the carrot. "Before you turned on the radio, I suppose. Why should that make me sad?"

Saturdays alone with Sophie were a delight he had not anticipated. When Sylvie had first announced her rigorous travel schedule, one week a month over the course of an entire year, it had seemed that these weekends would stretch on forever, the need to chase after Sophie and keep her entertained all day. But after a few months he found that they passed almost too quickly, that Sophie's nonstop chatter kept him endlessly fascinated, even if she never seemed to pick up her toys. With Sylvie's travel schedule winding down, this weekend would be their last alone, certainly for a long while, and presently it would be his wife answering these marvelous questions.

"Are you saying that the song made you sad, is that it?"

Sophie regarded him for a moment, a look of genuine concern. "Of course, that is exactly what I'm saying."

"Why then, it's a sad song. And it reminds you that Mama is gone. And that makes you sad." He put the pan away and turned towards her, leaning on the countertap and wiping his hands with a towel. He knew, somehow, that this answer would not satisfy her.

"Papa, what a perfectly silly thing to say." Sophie brushed her hand against the paper, in the process rubbing the few remaining bits of waxy crayon into smudges on the drawing, and then fixed her drawing to the refrigerator. "It's a sad song, of course it makes me sad. But why is it a sad song? It's just some instruments on the radio, a few sounds. How does that have anything to do with Mama? No one on the radio knows that she's gone, or even who she is. Why should that make me sad?"

The ground was still a little damp from rain earlier in the week, and so the soil yielded easily to the spade. Henry turned the dirt over, created a little mound, and pressed his thumb into the top.

"I'm ready for another seed, Poppet."

Sophie dug around in the little foil pouch, brightly painted with a pair of zucchini, and carefully pinched a single, tiny seed between thumb and forefinger, then dropped it into her father's waiting hand.

"Have you figured it out yet, Papa?"

He turned the question over in his head as he placed the seed into the little depression in the soil, heaped a little bit more dirt onto the top, and patted the completed mound flat.

"Have I figured out why that song made you sad? No, I'm afraid I haven't."

"Well - maybe you should turn it into a story. Like Mama says."

Sylvie loved to say things like that: There's no question that can't be answered by a good story. It was her favorite game with Sophie, to make up silly stories all day long, whether it was about someone feeding ducks at the park or the nice man at the post office. Easy enough for Sylvie to do, Henry thought - telling stories was what she did best.

"Well then, I'll do my best." Henry set his spade down on the ground, and sat back on his haunches. How did every good story begin? "Once upon a time, there was a king in a castle, who ruled over a vast kingdom..."

"No, Papa, you're telling it wrong!" Sophie stamped her foot into the edge of the garden, and it was only at that moment that Henry realized she had worn her new sneakers for the afternoon's chore. They were brand new, purchased just yesterday since Sophie had worn out her old pair. The sneakers were a gleaming color of white - or in any case, they had been yesterday - with a streak of purple on both sides and heels made of plastic with shiny red lights that turned on whenever Sophie took a step. "The story goes like this:"

She paused for a moment, looking down at her feet and then up into the billowy clouds above as though she had forgotten where she might have left something.

"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named... Stephie. And Stephie had a song. Her song's name was Yo."

"Yo?" Henry asked, He had started to pick up all the weeds they had tossed aside as they had prepared the zucchini patch. "Like the toy - a yo-yo?"

"No, not like that. Yo because it was short for yodel. Now, Stephie took Yo with her wherever she went. To the playground, to her friend's house, on picnics, into the bath... she even took Yo to school! And everywhere they went, she and Yo liked to sing together. When she was at school, Stephie and Yo would hum together while she read or did her homework."

"Well, that is a marvelous story. Was Yo a sad song, then?" Henry gathered all the little rocks they had unearthed into a little pile, and left it by the side of the garden.

"No! There's more to the story, you should know that! We haven't even reached the middle yet!" Sophie's face was drawn into a deep scowl, and without realizing it she had balled the packet of seeds into a fist.

"Very well, then, Poppet. Let's pick up the gardening things, and continue the story after we put them away. Ok?"

Mulberry bushes always seem to ripen in stages. The berries closest to the ground grow fat and blue, while those which are just a little higher stay skinny and red. Meanwhile, the berries high up at the top of the bush remain shriveled and green until late in the season.

At this time of year, it was only the berries at the very bottom of the bush which had ripened, so Henry sat on the ground, and Sophie kneeled on her knees, with a couple of glass jars scattered between them. Henry had filled up a whole jar before he remembered Sophie's story.

"Now then, where were we? Stephie was humming with Yo in school. Do you suppose she got in trouble for distracting her classmates?"

"Oh no, Papa, that would never happen, because Yo had a lovely voice. Why should anyone be cross to hear such a wonderful song?"

"Why indeed, Poppet? I don't know."

"You see, what had happened was that one day, while Stephie worked on her multiplication tables, she found that she could not quite remember the words to her song."

"How terrible! Was she forgetting Yo?" Henry wiped his hands on the grass to remove the sticky purple juice of the berries, and then screwed a lid onto the jar.

"Yes, I believe that's exactly what was happening. Just a little bit, mind you. She could still remember most of the words. But Stephie was frightened that one day she would forget them all."

"I should think so. So what did Stephie do?"

Sophie grabbed a berry from a branch just above her head, and popped it in her mouth. Henry thought about telling her, for the hundredth time, that she must wash the berries before eating them. Instead, he decided that he'd work on filling her jar.

"Well Papa, there was a great and powerful sorceress, who lived in the middle of a vast forest. Stephie decided that she and Yo should visit the sorceress, to see whether the sorceress had a potion which could help her memory."

"That must have been very brave of Stephie."

"Well, perhaps a bit. But she had Yo with her. She made plenty of peanut butter sandwiches, and packed them in her backpack. And as they hiked through the forest, Stephie and Yo sang and sang, which made the journey go quickly."

"What a good idea. Stephie sounds like quite a clever little girl."

Sophie shrugged. She had spotted a branch with a clump of ripened berries, hidden behind a big leaf. She reached forward to pluck them off the branch, and dropped them in her jar, one by one. "I think we might have enough berries now, Papa."

They had finished rolling out the dough and Sophie still had not mentioned the ending to her story. Henry had done his best to be patient, letting her think about it while they mashed up the berries, and waited for them to boil, and added sugar and syrup so that it would thicken.

With the table still covered in flour, he finally relented. "And so, Poppet? What happened when Stephie finally found the sorceress? Did she get her magic potion?"

"Oh, no, Papa," Sophie responded, chewing her lip as she carefully pushed the rolling pin over the dough one more time. "The sorceress didn't have such potions. In fact she was a little bit angry with Stephie for even asking in the first place."

"What sort of sorceress doesn't have a magic potion?"

"Well, a sorceress who lives in the middle of a vast forest, of course. She must be too busy helping little girls with their problems to bother brewing up potions."

"I see." Henry picked up the dough that Sophie had rolled out, and carefully set it in the pie tin. He and Sophie picked up spoons and began spooning the sticky mulberry jam out of the pot and on top of the dough. "So then - what did the sorceress do?"

"It was really quite simple, after all. 'Think of a time when you were sad, little girl,' the sorceress told Stephie. 'And ask your friend here to tell you about that time, whenever you are having trouble remembering Yo.'"

"So Yo became a song about a time when Stephie was said?" With the pie tin filled, Henry took a fork and crimped the edge of the pie, rotating the tin by degrees until the entire crust had been prepared.

"Oh yes, that is exactly what happened. Because you see Stephie's mother had once gone on a long, long voyage, into the forest, and she had still not returned. So Yo began to tell the story of that voyage into the forest."

"And did that help Stephie - did that help her remember Yo?" Henry opened the oven and slid the pie tin inside.

Sophie sat at the table, looking at the orange glow of the oven. Through the glass she could see the jam begin to bubble softly. In a few minutes it would solidify into a gel, and later that evening they'd have mulberry pie for dinner.

"Well, it did help her. But a curious thing happened - because as Yo began telling that story, Yo herself changed. In fact she split into two!"

"So now there were two of Yo? How marvelous." Henry had grabbed a sponge and had begun wiping down the kitchen table, wiping up the little drops of mulberry jam and stray bits of flower into his cupped hand.

"Yes, and in fact soon there wee many more than two - because the second Yo became friends with another little girl, and when that second Yo began telling another sad story, it again split into two, again and again."

"Well Poppet. Imagine that." Henry poured Sophie a glass of milk, and watched her as she watched the pie baking.
